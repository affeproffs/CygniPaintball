v1 - Pathfind to closest power and immediatly activate
     No crashing.

v2 - Only activate power if:
        5x5 area has certain amount of !ourColor
        or atleast an enemy in area.

v3+ - Pathfind to closest power and prioritize 
        trails with other colors.
      Check path from closest power to enemy which is closest
      -> calculate if we reach power before them
      -> if we are 4 steps ahead, we can "afford"
         to take a path which is 3 steps slower.
      -> if THEY are ahead, check if they are going
         towards the power-up 3(or more) steps
         in a row. If true, go for 2nd closest
         power-up instead.      
      
      - In A* - Keep track of # of colorable tiles in path, keep the best one (or keep top 3).
      - When no power-up, set goal as somewhere in the least inhabited quadrant
      - Send allowance to Astar (how many steps we can afford to be slower)
       - This is also useful for when there is no power-up, 
            -> we can set Astar(leastInhabitedQuadrant, allowance=3)
                       or Astar(cordinate 5 mu closer to leastInhabitedQuadrant, allowance=2)
